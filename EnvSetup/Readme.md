There is nothing specific for the setup of this enviropnment in terms of specific needs for kronometrix, 
these tools should be useful on any PowerShell project.

The tool chain consists of the following applicaitons:

* Choclatey packaging manager - See https://chocolatey.org/ for more information on the modules below.
* git version control 
* poshgit integration of git into powershell command line
* Storage for gtihub / teamserver accounts syncing to remote repositories

There are several alternatives that could have been used here (psget etc)...

After using the commands on a newly installed server / workstation the PowerShell ISE should be 
equipped for development need with a scripts directory in the home folder where a newly created 
script / function and test set is set up and opened for editing in the PowerShell ISE editor.
